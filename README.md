# Typerbot
If you like annoying a whole server by typing for 99 hours in a channel (only stops typing when you close the program)

Also, if you want to type in DM, copy the link of whatever message you want in the conversation with the guy you want to annoy and copy the id after the /@me/, it's the channel ID of your DM's
